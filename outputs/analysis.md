# üîç Project Analysis: Simple Todo API with Node.js and SQLite

## 1. üìä Project Overview

- **Brief Summary:** This project involves building a RESTful API for managing a todo list. The API will be developed using Node.js and will utilize SQLite as its database. It will support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for todo items.

- **Core Purpose and Value Proposition:** The core purpose is to provide a simple and efficient way for users to manage their tasks digitally. The value proposition is a lightweight, easily deployable, and maintainable solution for personal task management or integration into larger applications.

- **Target Audience/Users:**
    - Individual users looking for a simple task management solution.
    - Developers who need a basic todo API for learning or prototyping.
    - Small teams who need a quick and easy task tracking system.

## 2. üìã Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements:

-   **Create Todo:** The API must allow users to create new todo items with a title, description, and status (e.g., pending, completed).
-   **Read Todo:** The API must allow users to retrieve a single todo item by its ID.
-   **List Todos:** The API must allow users to retrieve a list of all todo items, optionally filtered by status.
-   **Update Todo:** The API must allow users to update the title, description, and status of an existing todo item.
-   **Delete Todo:** The API must allow users to delete a todo item by its ID.
-   **Error Handling:** The API must handle errors gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages.
-   **Data Validation:** The API must validate input data to ensure data integrity.
-   **Pagination (Optional):** For listing todos, consider implementing pagination for scalability.

### Non-functional Requirements:

-   **Performance:** The API should respond to requests quickly (e.g., under 200ms for most operations).
-   **Security:** The API should protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), even though authentication/authorization is not explicitly required.
-   **Scalability:** The API should be designed to handle a reasonable load of concurrent users. While SQLite has limitations, proper coding practices can mitigate potential issues for smaller applications.
-   **Maintainability:** The code should be well-organized, documented, and easy to understand.
-   **Reliability:** The API should be reliable and available, minimizing downtime.

### Business Requirements:

-   **Goal:** Provide a functional and usable todo API.
-   **Success Metrics:**
    -   Number of API calls served successfully per day.
    -   Average response time for API requests.
    -   Number of reported bugs or issues.
    -   Positive feedback from initial users/testers.
    -   Ease of deployment and maintenance.

## 3. üë• User Stories

-   **As a** user, **I want** to be able to create a new todo item with a title and description, **so that** I can keep track of my tasks. (High Priority)
-   **As a** user, **I want** to be able to view a list of all my todo items, **so that** I can see what tasks I need to complete. (High Priority)
-   **As a** user, **I want** to be able to mark a todo item as completed, **so that** I can track my progress. (High Priority)
-   **As a** user, **I want** to be able to view the details of a specific todo item, including its title, description, and status, **so that** I can get more information about the task. (Medium Priority)
-   **As a** user, **I want** to be able to edit an existing todo item, **so that** I can update the title, description, or status if needed. (Medium Priority)
-   **As a** user, **I want** to be able to delete a todo item, **so that** I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant. (Medium Priority)
-   **As a** user, **I want** to receive informative error messages when something goes wrong, **so that** I can understand the issue and take corrective action. (Medium Priority)
-   **As a** user, **I want** to be able to filter my todo items by status (e.g., pending, completed), **so that** I can focus on specific tasks. (Low Priority)

## 4. üèóÔ∏è Technical Requirements

-   **Programming Language:** JavaScript (Node.js)
-   **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    -   **Express.js:** For building the REST API.
    -   **SQLite3:** For interacting with the SQLite database.
    -   **Body-parser:** For parsing request bodies (deprecated in newer Express versions, consider using Express's built-in middleware).
    -   **Nodemon (optional):** For automatic server restarts during development.
    -   **Knex.js or Sequelize (optional):** ORM for easier database interactions (adds complexity but improves maintainability).
    -   **dotenv (optional):** For managing environment variables.
-   **Database:** SQLite
-   **External APIs:** No external APIs are explicitly required for this basic todo API.
-   **Infrastructure:**
    -   **Hosting:** Could be hosted on various platforms such as Heroku, AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, or a local development environment.
    -   **Deployment:** Simple deployment using Git and a platform-specific deployment process. Docker can be used for containerization and easier deployment.
    -   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

## 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Challenges

-   **Technical Risks:**
    -   **SQLite Limitations:** SQLite is not suitable for high-concurrency applications. Mitigation: Optimize database queries and consider using a more robust database if scalability becomes a major concern.
    -   **SQL Injection:** Using string concatenation to build SQL queries is a major security risk. Mitigation: Use parameterized queries or an ORM like Knex.js or Sequelize.
    -   **Asynchronous Operations:** Managing asynchronous operations in Node.js can be challenging. Mitigation: Use `async/await` for cleaner code and easier error handling.
-   **Potential Bottlenecks:**
    -   Database performance could be a bottleneck if the number of todo items grows significantly. Mitigation: Optimize database queries and consider database indexing.
-   **Security Considerations:**
    -   **Input Validation:** Validate all input data to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    -   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. (Not strictly required for a basic app, but good practice).
-   **Scalability Challenges:**
    -   SQLite's limitations make it difficult to scale the application horizontally. Mitigation: Consider migrating to a more scalable database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL if needed.

## 6. üìà Success Criteria
